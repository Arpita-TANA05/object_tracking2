Designed and implemented real-time visual object tracking systems using
adaptive correlation filters such as KCF (Kernelized Correlation Filters) and
MOSSE.
Achieved robust tracking performance under challenging conditions including
occlusion, scale variation, and illumination changes through adaptive filter
updates and feature integration. Developed Python/C++ modules with OpenCV, Dlib, and PyTorch to experiment
with various correlation-based tracking algorithms.
